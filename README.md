Traveller Android App [Work in progress ðŸš§]
==================

Traveller is a demo Android for travels and hotel reservation (inspired
by [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/cgIe4WYf01DECbulxPIGMZ/Travel-App-Design-(Community))).
This app built entirely with Kotlin and amazing Jetpack Compose. It follows Android design and
development best practices and is intended to be a portfolio app for me as middle android developer.

The app is currently in early stage development and is not yet available on the Play Store.

# Tech stack

This application built with modern Android and Kotlin technologies:

- Entire UI built with Jetpack Compose (in combination with
  the [Accompanist library](https://google.github.io/accompanist/))
- Kotlin Coroutines for async work
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Navigation built via Jetpack Compose Navigation
- Clean architecture and MVVM pattern for presentation layer
- Gradle KTS and libs catalog ðŸ”¥
- Firebase features ([Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?authuser=0)
  , [Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?authuser=0))

Technologies that haven't yet been implemented:
- Modularization
- Unit (using Hilt) and UI tests
- Firebase crashlytics and CI
- Support of dark theme (for now app support only light theme because I'm lack of colors for dark
  theme ðŸ˜”)

# Features

- Authentication flow
- Home screen with popular travel programs and popular destinations

Both the Log In Screen and the Sign Up screen consist 2 input fields and vailation for them.
